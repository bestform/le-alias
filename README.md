LE ALIAS
========
(author: le me)

Use your bash with le style.

To use it manually, just type le command:
    source le_alias.sh

You can add this line (with the correct path) to your .bashrc as the last line.

After execution, you can use every command in your path with the "le_" prefix.

like:
    le_mysqldump
    le_ls
    le_echo

Have le fun.
